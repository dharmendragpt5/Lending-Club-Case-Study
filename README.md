## Goals of data analysis:  

This assignment will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved or can 
reduce the error in every business using EDA. In this case, 
We will understand how quality of data is used to minimize the risk of 
loosing money while sanctioning loan to customers.

Sanctioning loans to applicants who is not able to pay the loan amount is the largest 
source of financial loss or NPA. The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower denies to pay the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these bad loan applicants, 
By avoiding this type of bad loans will reduced the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

    1. Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

        1. Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
        2. Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. 
        the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
        3 .Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, 
        i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 
        
    2 .Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not 
    meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history 
    of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)
